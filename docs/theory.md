# Theoretical Foundations
### Core Principles
1. **Triinfinity Coil Geometry**: Three figure-8 loops at 120-degree angles creating a triple vortex intersection.
2. **Transduction Stack**: Layering Terfenol-D and PZT-5H to convert magnetic fluctuations into high voltage.
3. **MHD Feedback**: Flowing liquid metal conductor creates a self-sustaining coupling loop.
