# Phase 1 Testing & Validation
### 1. Basic Power Balance
- **Input**: Measure the electrical power used by the liquid metal pump.
- **Output**: Measure the PZT stack voltage and current (P = V x I).
- **Goal**: Calculate efficiency (η = P_out / P_in). Target: η > 110%.

### 2. Isolation Tests
- **Faraday Cage**: Operate the unit inside a shielded cage to verify if output is dependent on ambient EM fields.
- **Thermal Calorimetry**: Measure heat flow to ensure the system isn't acting as a simple heat engine.
- **Vacuum Test**: Eliminate acoustic and convection variables to isolate the core mechanism.
